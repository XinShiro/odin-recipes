# odin-recipes
Here I have tried to build a basic recipe page using all the knowledge I have learned so far in TOP's Foundations course.

I have successfully added images to my webpage, links, created lists for the ingredients and steps of the recipes. Learnt to format the text within (eg. getting the text to be bold or italicized or highlighted).
