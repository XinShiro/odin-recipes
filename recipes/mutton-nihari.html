            <li>In a pan heat up the oil on medium heat until hot.</li>
            <li>Add the ginger paste and garlic paste then sauté for a few minutes on medium heat.</li>
            <li>Add the lamb or mutton and cook until the colour changes.</li>
            <li>While the lamb/mutton is cooking, grind the fennel seeds, cumin seeds, coriander seeds, black peppercorns, cinnamon, black cardamom pods, green cardamom pods, cloves and bay leaves until a fine powder is formed.</li>
            <li>Add the nihari masala powder, chilli powder, turmeric powder, and salt then cook the spices for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the water and cook for a further 2 hours on low heat until the meat is tender</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, mix the wheat flour and 100ml of water to form a smooth paste – this flour mixture acts as a thickening agent, if you want to thicken it more then add more flour.</li>
            <li>Add the flour mixture into the pan then cover with a lid and cook for 30 minutes on a low heat.</li>
            <li>In another pan, heat up the olive oil on medium heat until hot.</li>
            <li>Add the sliced onions and fry the sliced onions until browned and caramelised.</li>
            <li>Add the browned onions to the lamb along with the chopped coriander, julienned ginger, and finely diced chillies.</li>
